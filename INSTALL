Installation instructions for the ADFS plugin
=============================================

This INSTALL file describes how to perform a fresh installation of the ADFS Plugin version 2.0. For upgrading an
existing installation a separate UPGRADE document is available.

Version 2.0 of the ADFS Plugin was tested on Windows 2012R2, Windows 2016 and Windows 2019.

Version 2.0 of the ADFS Plugin should work with Stepup-Gateway version 2.7.0 or above, but is mainly tested against the
current version of the Stepup-Gateway (version 3.0.1)


Summary
=======

This version of the ADFS Plugin comes with a new installation process consisting of a text based setup program. You
start the setup program from an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server. You must run the setup program on each
AD FS server in your farm, starting with the master server.


Installation
============

The installation of the plugin must be performed on each AD FS Server in the farm, starting at the primary AD FS Server.
During the installation of the AD FS server the setup program will restart the AD FS service. If you are using an AD FS
farm, you can direct traffic away from the AD FS server being upgraded using your loadbalancer to prevent downtime.

The plugin distribution includes the current SAML configurations for several SURFsecureID environments: production,
pilot, test. The setup program lets you choose one of these configurations and automatically configures the plugin with
the parameters from the included configuration.

Edit the <TODO>.json file to configure the configuration available from the setup program.


Notices
-------

The installation process was tested with AD FS on Windows 2012R2, 2016 and 2019 with the AD FS configuration using a
Windows integrated database (WID). No testing ws performed with an AD FS that uses a central MSQL server.

Preparation
-----------

We recommend that you create a backup of the AD FS server(s) before you start the installation process

Download the zip file containing the new ADFS plugin from <TODO link>
and unpack it on each AD FS server you want to upgrade. Check the configuration of the AD FS server. You do this by
running the setup program in check mode. This performs a check of the current AD FS service and reports any problems
that it finds.

1. Open an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server
2. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -c".

The setup program requires the following information from you

Installation process
--------------------

### On the primary AD FS server

1. Start the installation on the primary AD FS Server. The AD FS service must be running
2. Open an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server
3. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -i" to install the
   plugin. This command will:
   - Ask you to select the configuration of Stepup-Gateway to use
   - Ask you to enter the local configuration settings:
     - EntityID for the Plugin
     - The SP signing certificate of the plugin
     - The name of the user's attribute in AD FS from which to get the user's uid for the Stepup-Gateway
     - The value for the schacHomeOrganization attribute your organisation is using with the Stepup-Gateway
   - Install the 2.x version of the plugin.
   - Restart the AD FS service
4. Verify that the AD FS service starts
5. In the logs of the AD FS service verify the plugin is being loaded
6. In the logs of hte AD FS plugin verify that the plugin was successfully initialised
7. The configuration setting of the plugin to sent to the Stepup-Gateway administrator were written to "TODO".
   Sent this file to the Stepup-Gateway administrator, this configuration must be added to the Stepup-Gateway for
   authentication with the plugin to be possible.

If you do not have secondary AD FS servers, you are done.


### On each secondary AD FS server

#### Preparation

1. The setup program saved the configuration choices you made during installation of the primary AD FS server to "TODO"
   on the primary.
   Copy this file to each secondary AD FS server to the same directory. This saves you from having to reenter the
   plugin configuration settings on the secondary server(s)
2. Bring the SP signing certificate you used on the primary to the secondary servers. If you generated this certificate
   during the installation it was exported as "TODO.pfx". Copy this file as well, and bring the encryption passphrase
   of the pfx.


#### Installation

1. Open an elevated command prompt on the secondary AD FS server
2. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -i" to install the
   plugin. This command will:
   - Ask you to select the configuration of Stepup-Gateway to use
   - Ask you to enter the local configuration settings. You can view and change the settings. They will have been be
     read from the "TODO" file you copied from the primary so the current configuration should match the configuration
     values you entered there.
   - Asked for the SP signing certificate if it is not already in the Certificate Store. Choose import to import the
     .pfx file you brought from the secondary.
   - Register the plugin with the AD FS service
   - Install the 2.x version of the plugin.
   - Restart the AD FS service
3. Verify that the AD FS service starts
4. In the logs of the AD FS service verify the plugin is being loaded
5. In the logs of hte AD FS plugin verify that the plugin was successfully initialised

Repeat this same process on any other AD FS secondary you have.


Changing the plugin configuration
=================================

Each plugin stores it's configuration on the AD FS server locally in the /Windows/ADFS directory. The configuration is
only read when the plugin is loaded by the AD FS service. This means the AD FS service must be restarted after making
changes to the plugin configuration.

You typically want the configuration of the plugin to be the same on each AD FS server in the farm. So if you make a
change to the plugin in one AD FS servers, you want to repeat the change on each other server. You can use the
"TODO current settings" file to transport settings between AD FS servers.

Change the configuration of the plugin by running the setup program in "reconfigure" mode.
1. Open an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server where you want to change the configuration
2. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -r" to install the
   plugin. This command:
   - Allows you to change each of the configuration settings of the plugin
   - Restart the AD FS service


Uninstalling the plugin configuration
=====================================

1. Start the uninstallation process on the primary AD FS Server. The AD FS service must be running
2. Open an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server
3. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -x" to uninstall the
   plugin. This command will:
   - Deregister the AD FS plugin with the AD FS service
   - Remove the Plugin files from the \Windows\ADFS directory. Removed files are moved to the "TODO backup" directory
   - Restart the AD FS service

Repeat the command on each AD FS secondary server to remove the plugin's file from the \Windows\ADFS directory and
restart the AD FS service.


Diagnostics / troubleshooting
=============================

Problems during installation:

- The setup program stores a log of al actions performed in "MFA-extension.SetupLog.txt" in the same directory as the
  "setup.exe" program.
- The setup program creates a backup of the files it removes or modifies in "TODO backup" directory

You can run the setup program in check mode to diagnose installation issues. This does not make any changes:

1. Open an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server
2. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -c".

- You can run the setup program in repair mode to try to fix (repair) an existing 2.x installation:

1. Open an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server
2. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -f".


Problems with the plugin
========================

When the plugin was installed successfully, but there are problem using the plugin:

1. Check the event log of the AD FS Service for errors.
2. The plugin has it's own event log "ADFS Plugin". Check this log for errors.
