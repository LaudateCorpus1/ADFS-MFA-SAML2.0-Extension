Upgrade instructions for the ADFS plugin
========================================

This UPGRADE file describes how to upgrade the ADFS Plugin versions 1.0 and 1.0.1 to version 2.0. These are the only
versions of the plugin that have been publicly released. An existing installation will run version 1.0 or version 1.0.1
of the plugin. The upgrade instruction for both versions are the same.

Version 2.0 of the ADFS Plugin was tested on Windows 2012R2, Windows 2016 and Windows 2019.


Summary
=======

The new version of the DFS Plugin comes with a new installation process consisting of a text based setup program. You
start the setup program from a command prompt on the AD FS server. The setup program will upgrade a running AD FS server
with a 1.x version of the ADFS plugin to version 2 of the ADFS plugin without the need for additional configuration. You
must run the upgrade on each AD FS server in your farm, starting with the master server.

Do NOT run the uninstall script that came with the version 1.x of the plugin.


What is new in version 2.0
==========================

Version 2.0 of the plugin adds support for configuring two signing certificates, this allows key rollover scenarios to
be supported with minimal downtime.

The plugin includes a new setup program that allows installation, uninstallation, upgrading and reconfiguring the
plugin. The setup program can also run a diagnostic check of the configuration of the plugin. The setup program has a
text based user interface and must be started from an elevated command prompt.

Support looking up users in multiple domains and forests. The ADFS Plugin, its dependencies and its configuration files
are now located in the ADFS directory (i.e. C:/Windows/ADFS). The plugin no longer stores part of its configuration in
the configuration file of the AD FS Service.

Improved logging and error handling

The plugin distribution includes the current SAML configurations for several SURFsecureID environments: production,
pilot, test. When the IdP EntityID that is currently configured in the plugin is present in the available
configurations, the setup program automatically updates the configuration of the plugin with the parameters from
the included configuration.

Edit the <TODO>.json file to configure the configuration available from the setup program.


Installation
============

The upgrade must be performed on each AD FS Server in the farm, starting at the primary AD FS Server. During the upgrade
of the AD FS server the setup program will restart the AD FS service. If you are using an AD FS farm, you can direct
traffic away from the AD FS server being upgraded using your loadbalancer to prevent downtime. A running ADFS plugin on
another AD FS server will continue to work, however (re)starting a AD FS service that has not yet been upgraded may
fail.

Notices
-------

After upgrading the primary AD FS server, a secondary AD FS service that is still running the old version of the ADFS
plugin can fail to load the ADFS plugin when the AD FS service is restarted.

The upgrade process was tested with AD FS on Windows 2012R2, 2016 and 2019 with the AD FS configuration using a Windows
integrated database (WID). No testing ws performed with an AD FS that uses a central MSQL server.

Preparation
-----------

We recommend that you create a backup of the AD FS server(s) before you start the upgrade process

Download the zip file containing the new ADFS plugin from <link> and unpack it on each AD FS server you want to upgrade
Check the configuration and the plugin on each ADFS server. You do this by running the setup program in check mode. This
performs a check of the current installation and will report any problems that it finds:

1. Open an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server
2. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -c".

Upgrade process
---------------

1. Start the upgrade on the primary AD FS Server. The AD FS service must be running
2. Open an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server
3. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -i" to upgrade the
   plugin. This command will:
   - Remove the 1.x version of the plugin
   - Upgrade the 1.x configuration files to the format required by 2.x
   - Install the 2.x version of the plugin.
   - Restart the AD FS service
   - Test that the plugin works
   - After the upgrade of the primary AD FS server is complete, upgrade the ADFS Plugin on the secondary AD FS
     server(s).

Diagnostics / troubleshooting
-----------------------------

Problems during installation:

- The setup program stores a log of al actions performed in "MFA-extension.SetupLog.txt" in the same directory as "setup.exe".
- The setup program creates a backup of the files it removes or modifies in <TODO>

You can run the setup program in check mode to diagnose installation issues. This does not make any changes:

1. Open an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server
2. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -c".

- You can run the setup program in repair mode to try to fix (repair) an existing 2.x installation:

1. Open an elevated command prompt on the AD FS server
2. Change to the directory where you unpacked the 2.0 version of the plugin and run "setup.exe -f".


Problems with the plugin
------------------------

When the plugin was installed successfully, but there are problem using the plugin:

1. Check the event log of the AD FS Service for errors.
2. The plugin has it's own event log "ADFS Plugin". Check this log for errors.
